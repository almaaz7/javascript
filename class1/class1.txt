why javascript is scripting language?ECMAScript.
small programs are known as script so it is called javascript.
functional language is a language which can make function within funciton.
V8 is responsible for compiling and interpreting javascript.
javascript borrowed from scheme (genreal purpose programming lanurage), AWK,self,perl,python.
loosely/ weakly typed language.need not to tell the type of variable or type of parameter in function
all datatype are internally defined
js has implicit dataType
DataType all are immutable stores value
1. undefined
2. number (0-9), Decimal
3. string double or single quote. backtick`` will create multiline string feature in ecma6
global variable are declared with without declaring type
a function which return nothing will return undefined.
console.log(`a is ${a} b is ${b}`); this is known as string Template or string interpolation created in ecma6
== vs ===
4. == this do typecasting and do comparison this is called loose Camparison
 === this will do strict comparison first compare the datatype then give answer
while conversion
    String + Number = String
    NUmber + string = string
parseInt("10") typecast
NaN-not a number type is Number error value
isNan(a)?0:a; ternary operator
error value in number Infinity for this isFinite() is there
5. Boolean true or false
        boolean + number = number
        boolean + string = string
it can store maximum 8 byte storage in ecma2020 version new storage was introduced "bigInt" beyond 64 bit put 'n' after the number.
TypeError when different data time cannot combine
a = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER maximum value which is avilable and less than bigint
convert string to BigInt("23432");
larger value of the number
6. null means no refrence we want to remove object from the memory
Important question Diff between undifined and null.
typeOf Null is object but typeof undefined is undefined 
7. Symbol(Ecma6 rare to use)
    always generate unique things.generate
    noduplicasy to make unique keys

Mutable datatype stores address(works with reference)
1. Array[]specific
to make things for garbage collector
    make it null
    defrence
    make function and make scope limit

2. Object{}generic
    var a = {};


    to check specific type
    arr "instanceof" Array; 

[] vs {}
