Questions:
    What is JS engine?
    What is wrapper types? why it present?
    what is AutoBoxing?
    what is binding and what is its type?
    Arguments vs Rest?


Primitives in js
    Primitives are value type.
    Primitive are not objects they have pure values it doesnt attach any method, it means no possible way to mutate the values, so thats why the yare immutable.

When we put (.) in front of dataType it will explicitely convert dataType to object ==> Auto Boxing    

Reference Type/Non primitive type in js
    Acting like a pointer holding the reference of a value.
    vvar e = arr=> will not create copy
    var e = [...arr] => will clone they have copy for each. ==> spread operator

    Objects are always store in Heap Memory

Wrapper Object,
    when we do stirng var.toUpperCase() it do autoboxing behind the scene.

    After conversion it become mutable and it has access to property and methods and once method call done it is become normal.

console.dir(funciton_name) => shows internal sturcture of function.

Weekly types function-
    e.g add() 
    add(10,20)
    add(10,20,30)
    add(10,20,30,40,50,60)
    add(10,"20",30,"four","one")
    add(10,[20,"30",one],"40","four",five)
    function one(){
        return 1;
    }
    function five(){
        return "5";
    }


    Object binding-
        when we create function it get binded with the window.
        window.add();
        add(); (default binding)
        Implicit Binding- when function is binded with object; to excape from the global function.
        var obj = {
            add();
        }
    Types of binding
        -implicit binding
        -default binding
        -explicit binding

Function with default argument        

    undefined,null,NaN,false,0 --> FALSY
    other are TRUTHY

    function add(x=0){} ==> default value.

Function with rest argument 
    function add(...arg){} => rest argument can have n no. of arguments.

Arguments vs Rest.
    Argument implicit   |  Rest explicit, rest is Array, Rest is the last argument always. Rest cannot be two.

Spread vs rest
    rest always work with funciton argument of function | spread work with array and object.


Types of Function
    -Names Function
    -Anonymous Function
