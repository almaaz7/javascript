We will be making a Note MAking App and will perform crud operation from javaScript
-we use bootstrap to create the structure of the App

Design Pattern
    MVC - Model View Controller
Add operation
    1. Read all input fields?
    2. Store all the field values where?
All firlds values goes in object and object will be store in array
Array use for further operation
    3. Objects are belongs to Notes Types.
if we create a generic object(object literal)
var obj ={};//belong to GOD(object)
We need a specific kind of object
e.g. Notes types of object, so notes types it is a ES6 class.

After add we need to print the data in the table body. so dynamically create a new row and print the object in the row.
Object fields will be print one bu one in the table cell.
Also we need to create, edit and trash icons dynamically.

Update the Total Record

Delete operation
    0. by default delete button should be disabled
    1. Icon must be clickable (hint css) -> by css making hand class and cursor property.
    2. Add click event (this of row) -> Icon -> parent -> TD -> parent -> TR, tr color set red..
    3. Every Object has key isMarked = false;
    4. Icon has id, so fetch the id and search in array (find or findindex) -> u get and object.
        object isMarked = true;
    5. Count mark - count thoise object in array whose isMarked = true, opposite Unmark
    Delet button by default disable
    when count mark is > 0 then only delte button enable.
    when delete button click so it will delete those records whose isMArked = true [hint : Filter].    

    Khud ka id banao aur uski value set karo by using setAttribute('attribute_name',value);
