We will be making a Note MAking App and will perform crud operation from javaScript
-we use bootstrap to create the structure of the App

Design Pattern
    MVC - Model View Controller
Add operation
    1. Read all input fields?
    2. Store all the field values where?
All firlds values goes in object and object will be store in array
Array use for further operation
    3. Objects are belongs to Notes Types.
if we create a generic object(object literal)
var obj ={};//belong to GOD(object)
We need a specific kind of object
e.g. Notes types of object, so notes types it is a ES6 class.

After add we need to print the data in the table body. so dynamically create a new row and print the object in the row.
Object fields will be print one bu one in the table cell.
Also we need to create, edit and trash icons dynamically.
