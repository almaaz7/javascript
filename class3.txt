Primitives in js
    Primitives are value type.
    Primitive are not objects they have pure values it doesnt attach any method, it means no possible way to mutate the values, so thats why the yare immutable

Reference Type/Non primitive type in js
    Acting like a pointer holding the reference of a value.
    vvar e = arr=> will not create copy
    var e = [...arr] => will clone they have copy for each. ==> spread operator

    Objects are always store in Heap Memory
